        <h2>Embedded System – What is it?</h2>
        <p>    Whenever I hear the term <strong>“Embedded System”</strong>, what comes to mind is “A combination of hardware and software” as instructed at the colleges. Well, instead of calling it as merely a combination of hardware and software, it would be apt to define it as application specific, organized hardware, controlled by specific software in which the hardware and software are the components of the embedded system. And there are many versions of the definition of an embedded system which ultimately culminate as said above.</p>

        <h2>“Parts” of an embedded system?</h2>
        <p>    Mainly, the hardware components constitute power source, microcontroller/microprocessor, timers, memory, and whatever needed for running the specific task. And the software components constitute programs such as compilers, integrated development environments (IDE), assemblers, simulators etc., which are used to create codes that “instruct” the hardware to do the assigned job in an efficient manner.</p>

        <p>Notable computer languages that are used for programming in embedded systems are embedded C, embedded C++, embedded JAVA and assembly. Here embedded C and others contain a specific library for a microcontroller to work. (Like the specific header files such as math.h, conio.h). Mostly, for simple applications, an assembly is used, which produces more efficient, compact codes.</p>

        <p>Some of the open-source operating systems used in embedded systems are Android, Microcontroller operating system (µCOS), VS works.</p>

        <h2>The secret of Processor/Controller</h2>
        <p>    Microcontroller/microprocessor is analogous to the brain of the embedded system. It performs all the calculation and decision part of the process. You would be surprised to know that the only arithmetic operation the processor/controller is capable of doing is, addition! (and the modern computer too). Multiplication is repeated addition, subtraction is the addition of negative numbers and division is repeated addition of negative numbers.</p>

        <h2>War at the core <br> processor vs. controller :</h2>
        <p>In most of the embedded systems, a microcontroller is chosen. Because, as you all know, we can call the microcontroller as a mini-computer. The microcontroller integrates many useful components such as memory, timers, counters, ADC, DAC etc onto the same package along with the controller. In contrast, for a microprocessor, timers, counters are to be provided separately and memory should also be interfaced separately which involves some additional circuitry and again which eats more space. One of the major goals of embedded system devices is compactness. Hence, embedded system vendors mostly adopt for microcontrollers.</p>
